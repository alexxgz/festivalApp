# Fest.y

Welcome to fest.y, our template for a music festival website! 

## User Story

The intent of fest.y is to have a clean and simple website with the ability to add and edit stages, artists, merchandise, and more (with time)! Based on the credential you submit to log in, you will either be a simple viewer of the site, or be given the auth to create/edit/update/delete entries.


## ERD

Here is an ERD of both our imagined MVP, as well as future icebox goals. 


## Future icebox goals

This is a very promising WIP that we are both very excited about continuing to build on in the future. Here are some of the most pressing icebox features for us:

### a larger asset library

Specifically images of artists, stages, and particular festivals

### more API integration

having the ability to add spotify/soundcloud/bandcamp links to the top hits of each artist, bio's/fun facts about each artist/festival, and more

### An editable schedule model

optimally, this would be pre-formatted to look like a schedule, and the admin of the site is able to just plug and play dates, set times, and artists.
